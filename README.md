#### Learning goals for this lesson:

* Define the null and alternative hypothesis. 
* Understand the difference between one-tailed and two-tailed tests.  
* Define the significance threshold $\alpha$ and its relation to p-value. 
* Differentiate when to use z-tests vs. t-tests.
* Perform z-tests and t-tests using Python libraries.
* Calculate p-values for z-tests and t-tests. 
* Differentiate between Type 1 and Type 2 error.

#### Misconceptions / Notes

A common misconception is that you can accept the alternative hypothesis. 

_**This is not true.**_

We either _reject_ or _fail to reject_ the null hypothesis at a given significance level $\alpha$.
